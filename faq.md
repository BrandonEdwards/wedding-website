### What's the RSVP deadline?

Please RSVP by May 1st so we can lock in numbers with the caterers and buy enough wine ðŸ™‚

### What should I wear?

The only event with a dress code is on Saturday. 

Our theme is *"Riviera Chic"*. Think linen, open collars, sandals & midi dresses.

It's likey going to be hot, with an average daytime temp of 27Â°C, so don't feel the need to wear a suit. If it's a scorcher, shorts are encouraged (we want you to enjoy yourself, not suffer!).

If you want to take a dip in the pool make sure to bring your swimmers!


### Can I bring my kids?

We really do love kids, however the Saturday events will be adults only. Feel free to bring them to events on Friday and Sunday. Let us know if you have questions!

### Can I bring a plus one?

Please check your invite!

### Is the wedding outdoors?

Assuming the weather is good, the ceremony will be outdoors. Dinner will be served in the marquee. The grounds are pretty amazing, so expect to walk around outside.

### Who made the website?

Archie, of course ðŸ˜€
