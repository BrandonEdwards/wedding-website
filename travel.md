There are more ways than this to get there than this, but we think many people will consider these options.

### By Plane ‚úàÔ∏è


There are two major airports nearby, that have many direct flights per day from London, Paris and other nearby European destinations. Both have lots of car rental options.

- **Lyon-Saint Exup√©ry Airport**
    - 1hr 40 flight from London.
    - 1hr 25 drive to wedding venue
- **Marseille Provence Airport**
    - 1hr 55 flight from London.
    - 1hr 30 drive to wedding venue


### By Train üöÑ

You can get closer to the venue by train, but it may involve more travel time for UK guests. For non-European residents, this may be preferrable to changing to another plane in Paris

- **High Speed Train to Gare Valence TGV**
    - Possible good option for those flying into France from further afield (eg North America)
    - 2hr 52 train from Paris Charles de Gaulle Airport
    - 2hr 15 train from Paris Gare de Lyon
    - 30 min drive to venue
        - There seems to be a local taxi company: [https://goo.gl/maps/kYnRsqoHtsyBN99PA](https://goo.gl/maps/kYnRsqoHtsyBN99PA)
